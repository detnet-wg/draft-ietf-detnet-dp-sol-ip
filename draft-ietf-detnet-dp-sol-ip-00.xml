 <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
  <t>
    Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
    DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
    delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    This document specifies the DetNet data plane and the on-wire encapsulation of DetNet flows over
    an IP network. The specified encapsulation provides the building blocks to enable the DetNet
    service layer functions and allow flow identification as described in the DetNet Architecture. 
  </t>
  <t>
    The DetNet transport layer functionality that provides congestion protection for DetNet flows
    is assumed to be in place in a DetNet node.
  </t>
  <t>
   Furthermore, this document also describes how DetNet flows are identified, how a DetNet
   Relay/Edge/Transit nodes work, and how the Packet Replication and Elimination function (PREF) is
   implemented with the IP data plane solution(s).
	  
  [JiK] PROEF is possible within a domain using domain specific means. Across domain is outside of scope of this document.	  
	  
  </t>
  <t>
   This document does not define the associated control plane functions, or Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  It also does not specify traffic handling capabilities
   required to deliver congestion protection and latency control for DetNet flows at the DetNet
   transport layer.

 <section title="DetNet data plane overview" anchor="sec_dt_dp">
  <t>
   This document describes how to use IP to support a data plane method of flow
   identification and packet forwarding over layer-3. Two different cases are covered: (i) the
   inter-connect scenario, in which IEEE802.1 TSN is routed over a layer-3 network (i.e., to enlarge
   the layer-2 domain), and (ii) native connectivity between DetNet-aware end systems.
  </t>
  <t>
   [Editor's note: these two scenarios does not cover all the defined use-cases.]
  </t>
  <t>
   <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/> illustrates how DetNet can provide services for a possibly IEEE 802.1TSN aware 
   IP end systems over a DetNet enabled network.  The edge nodes insert and remove required DetNet data
   plane encapsulation.  The 'X' in the edge and relay nodes represents a potential DetNet flow
   packet replication and elimination point.  This conceptually parallels L2VPN services, and could
   leverage existing related solutions as discussed below.
  </t>

 <t>
  [Jik] merge this text with the above.
	 <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/> illustrates how end to end IP-based DetNet service
  can be provided. In this case, the end systems are able to send and receive
  DetNet flows. 
	 [JiK] Add text that link/subnet can be TSN or MPLS or something else in the far future.

<section title="DetNet data plane requirements">
 <t>
 Two major groups of scenarios can be distinguished which require flow
 identification during transport:
 </t>

 <t><list style="numbers">
  <t>DetNet function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>Congestion protection and latency control: usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping).</t>
   <t>Explicit routes: select/apply the flow specific path.</t>
   <t>Service protection: recognize DetNet compound and member flows for replication an elimination.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 <t>OAM function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>troubleshooting (e.g., identify misbehaving flows, etc.)</t>
   <t>recognize flow(s) for analytics (e.g., increase counters, etc.)</t>
   <t>correlate events with flows (e.g., volume above threshold, etc.)</t>
   <t>etc.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 </list></t>
 <t>
	 [JiK] Local-ID needs to go away. Replace it with e.g. "6-tuple" which is defined/discussed in "DetNet IP flow identification" subsection above line 312.
	 
  Each DetNet node (edge, relay and transit) use an internal/implementation specific local-ID of the
  DetNet(-compound)-flow in order to accomplish its role during transport. Recognizing the DetNet
  flow is more relaxed for edge and relay nodes, as they are fully aware of both the DetNet service
  and transport layers. The primary DetNet role of intermediate transport nodes is limited to
  ensuring congestion protection and latency control for the above listed DetNet functions.
 </t>
 <t>
	 [JiK] Flow aggregation is FFS. Might be a separate document.
  The DetNet data plane allows for the aggregation of DetNet flows, e.g., via additional tunneling, to improved scaling.  When DetNet flows are aggregated, transit nodes may have limited
  ability to provide service on per-flow DetNet identifiers. Therefore, identifying each individual
  DetNet flow on a transit node may not be achieved in some network scenarios, but DetNet service
  can still be assured in these scenarios through resource allocation and control.
 </t>

 <t>
  On each DetNet node dealing with DetNet flows, an internal local-ID is assumed to determine what
  local operation a packet goes through. Therefore, local-IDs has to be unique on each edge and
  relay nodes. Local-ID is unambiguously bound to the DetNet flow.

</section>
 <section title="Packet replication, ordering and elimination considerations">
 <t>
	 [jik] Update this section to talk about links and subnets. Remove the rest..
 </t>
<t>
   DetNet service layer introduces packet replication and elimination functionality (PREF) for use
   in DetNet edge and relay node and end system packet processing.  PREF MAY be enabled in a DetNet
   node and the required processing is only applied to packets with  a positive flow identification
   at the DetNet service layer. PREF utilizes a sequence number carried within a DetNet flow
   packets.
  </t>
  <t>
   At a DetNet node level the output of the PREF elimination function is always a single packet.
   The output of the PREF replication function at a DetNet node level is always one or more packets
   (i.e., 1:N replication). The replicated packets MUST share the same d-CW i.e., the sequence
   number is the same for each member flow of the compound flow. The location and mechanism on the
   packet processing pipeline used for replication is implementation specific.
  </t>
  <t>
   The complex part of the DetNet PREF processing is tracking the history of received packets for
   multiple DetNet member flows. These ingress DetNet member flows (to a node) MUST have the same
   local-ID if they belong to the same DetNet (compound) flow and share the same sequence number
   counter and the history information. The location of the packet elimination on the packet
   processing pipeline is implementation specific.
  </t>
  <t>     
   DetNet service layer introduces also packet reordering functionality for use in DetNet edge and
   relay node and end system packet processing. The reordering functionality MAY be enabled in a
   DetNet node. The reordeing functionality relies on a presence of sequence numbers in a DetNet
   (compound) flows. The reordering processing is only applied to packets with  a positive flow
   identification at the DetNet service layer.
[JiK] ECMP SHOULD NOT be used.

 <section title="End-system specific considerations">
  <t>
	  [JiK] Update according to the "simplified-IP" theme
  Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on end-systems. Encapsulation depends on application and its preferences. In a DetNet (or even a TSN) domain the DN (TSN) functions use at most two flow parameters, namely Flow-ID and Sequence Number. However, an application may exchange further flow related parameters (e.g., time-stamp), which are not considered by DN functions. 
  </t>
  
  <t> Two types of end-systems are distinguished: 
  <list style="symbols">
	<t> L2 (Ethernet) end-system: application directly over L2 </t>
	<t> L3 (IP) end-system: application over L3  </t>
    </list>
  </t>
  
  <t> In case of Ethernet end-systems the application data is encapsulated directly in L2. From the DN domain perspective no upper layer protocols are visible. The Data-flow uses only Ethernet tag(s) and further flow specific parameters (if needed) are hidden inside the PDU. 
  </t>

  <t> The IP end-system scenario is different. Data-flows are encapsulated directly in L3 (i.e., IP) and the application may use further upper layer protocols (e.g., RTP). Many valid combinations exist, and it may be application specific how the IP header fields are used. Also, usage of further upper layer protocols depends on application requirements (e.g., time-stamp). Some examples for encoding of Flow-ID or Sequence Number attributes: IP address, IPv6-Flow-label, L4 ports, RTP-header, etc. 
  </t>

  <t> As a general rule, DetNet domains MUST be capable to forward any Data-flows and the DetNet domain MUST NOT intend to mandate end-system encapsulation format. 
  </t>

  <t> Furthermore, no application-level-proxy function is envisioned inside the DetNet domain, so end-systems peer with end-systems using the same application encapsulation format (see figure below):
    <list style="symbols">
	<t> L2 end-systems peer with L2 end-systems and </t>
	<t> L3 end-systems peer with L3 end-systems.</t>
    </list>

    Note: the DetNet Service Flow MUST be mapped to the link / sub net specific resources using an
    underlying system specific means. This implies each DetNet aware node on path MUST look into the
    transported DetNet Service Flow packet and utilize e.g., a five (or six) tuple to find out the required
    mapping within a node.  As noted earlier, the Service Protection is done within each link / sub net
    independently using the domain specific mechanisms (due the lack of a unified end to end
    sequencing information that would be available for intermediate nodes). If end to end service
    protection is desired that can be implemented, for example, by the DetNet end systems using

  <t> 
	  [JiK] Note to self.. DN-IWF -> DN-RF and RF stands for routing function. Be conservative introducing a new term ;)
    Note: DN-RF are not considered for the simplified IP scenario. DN-IWF is more relevant for IP PSN 
	with tunneling. 
  </t>


<section title="Networks with multiple technology segments" anchor="nwsegments">

  <t>
   There are network scenarios, where the DetNet domain contains multiple technology segments (IP,
   MPLS) and all those segments are under the same administrative control (see <xref
   target="fig_pref_xcrs_segments"/>). Furthermore, DetNet nodes may be interconnected via TSN
   segments.
  </t>
  
  <t> An important aspect of DetNet network design is placement of DetNet functions across the
  domain. Designs based on segment-by-segment optimization can provide only suboptimal solutions. In
  order to achieve global optimum Inter-Working Functions (DN-IWF) can be placed at segment border
  nodes, which stich together DetNet flows across connected segments.    </t>
 
  <t> DN-RF may ensure that flow attributes are correlated across segment borders. For example,
  there are two DetNet functions which require Sequence Numbers: (1) Elimination: removes duplications
  from flows and (2) IOD: ensures in-order-delivery of packet in a flow. Stitching flows together
  and correlating attributes means for example that replication of packets can happen in one segment
  and elimination of duplicates in a different one.   </t>

  <t>
	  [JiK] Adapt to the simplified-IP theme
	  
	  The ultimate goal of DN-IWF is to (1) match and (2) translate segment specific flow attributes. The DN-IWF ensures that segment specific attributes comprise per domain unique attributes for the whole DetNet domain. This characteristic can ensure that DetNet functions can be based on per domain attributes and not per segment attributes.   
  </t>  

  <t> The two DetNet specific attributes have the following characteristics:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t> Flow-ID: it is same in all packets of a flow </t>
   <t> Sequence Number: it is different packet-by-packet </t>
  </list>
  </t>  

  <t> For the Flow-ID the DN-IWF can implement a static mapping. The situation is more complicated for Sequence Number as it is different packet-by-packet, so it may need more sophisticated translation unless its format is exactly the same in the two technology segments. In this later case the DN-IWF can simple copy the Sequence Number field between the tunneling encapsulation of the two technology segments.  
  </t>  
  
  <t> In case of three technology segments (IP, MPLS and TSN) three DN-IWF functions can be specified. In the rest of this section the focus is on the (1) IP - MPLS network scenario. Note: the use-cases are out-of-scope for (2) TSN - IP, (3) TSN - MPLS. Note2: in current discussions the DetNet Sequence Number has an incompatible format with TSN.
  </t>

  <t> Simplest implementation of DN-IWF is provided if the flow attributes have the same format. Such a common denominator of the tunnel encapsulation format is the pseudowire encapsulation over both IP and MPLS.

 <section title="Class of Service">
  <t> [JiK] this section is TBD
  </t>
   <t>
     Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
     often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
     CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
     treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer
     to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
     specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
     mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
     differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
     target="RFC2474"/> and MPLS label traffic class field <xref
     target="RFC5462"/>, and at Layer-2, by IEEE 802.1p priority code
     point (PCP).
   </t>
   <t>
     CoS for DetNet flows carried in PWs and MPLS is provided using the
     existing MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture <xref
     target="RFC3270"/>.  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes MAY
     be used to support DetNet flows.  The Traffic Class field (formerly
     the EXP field) of an MPLS label follows the definition of <xref
     target="RFC5462"/> and <xref target="RFC3270"/>.  The Uniform,
     Pipe, and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and TTL processing models
     are described in <xref target="RFC3270"/> and <xref
     target="RFC3443"/> and MAY be used for MPLS LSPs supporting DetNet
     flows. MPLS ECN MAY also be used as defined in ECN <xref
     target="RFC5129"/> and updated by <xref target="RFC5462"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
     CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
     differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
     target="RFC2474"/> and related mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit
     congestion notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> field MAY
     also be used.
  </t>
  <t>
    One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
    services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do
    not impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms
    used to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to
    requirement for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the
    resources allocated to TE LSPs via <xref target="RFC3473"/>.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Quality of Service">
  <t> [JiK] Keep this. We should document tech. specific discussion may go somewhere else. We should start having it here and then decide whether to move to some other document.
	  
  </t>
    <t>
     Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic treatment typically includes a
     guarantee/agreement for the service, and allocation of resources to support the service.
     Example QoS mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control, flow
     identification and isolation, and sometimes path control, traffic protection, shaping, policing
     and remarking. Example protocols that support QoS control include <xref
     target="RFC2205">Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)</xref> (RSVP) and RSVP-TE <xref
     target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  The existing MPLS mechanisms defined to
     support CoS <xref target="RFC3270"/> can also be used to reserve resources for specific traffic
     classes. 
    </t>
    <t>
     In addition to explicit routes, and packet replication and elimination, DetNet provides zero
     congestion loss and bounded latency and jitter.  As described in <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, there are different mechanisms that maybe used
     separately or in combination to deliver a zero congestion loss service.  These mechanisms are
     provided by the either the MPLS or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms defined
     by the underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.
    </t>
   <t>
     A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
     and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
     <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  TE LSPs can
     also support explicit routes (path pinning).  Current service
     definitions for packet TE LSPs can be found in "Specification of
     the Controlled Load Quality of Service", <xref target="RFC2211"/>,
     "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service", <xref
     target="RFC2212"/>, and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", <xref
     target="RFC6003"/>. Additional service definitions are expected in
     future documents to support the full range of DetNet services.
     In all cases, the existing label-based marking mechanisms defined
     for TE-LSPs and even E-LSPs are use to support the identification
     of flows requiring DetNet QoS.
   </t>
   <t>
     QoS for DetNet service flows carried in IP MUST be provided locally by
     the DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such
     support will leverage the underlying network layer such as
     802.1TSN.  The traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for
     IP encapsulated DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future
     document.  From an encapsulation perspective, and as defined in
     <xref target="simple-ip-solution"/>, the combination of the "6 tuple" i.e.,
     the typical 5 tuple enhanced with the DSCP code, uniquely identifies a DetNet
     service flow.
   </t>
   <t>
    Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but that have not been
    the subject of a completed reservation, can disrupt the QoS offered to properly
    reserved DetNet flows by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore,
    the network nodes of a DetNet network MUST:
    
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
          Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet CoS)
          packets received that are not the subject of a completed reservation.
      </t><t>
          Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for
          DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a DetNet Class of Service
          marker.

 <section title="Cross-DetNet flow resource aggregation" anchor="Aggregation">
  <t> [JiK] Aggregation is FFS
  </t>
   <t>
     The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
     resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
     for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
     control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
     related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
     control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
     queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
     documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
     independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
   </t>
   <t>
       <t>
     DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
     options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
     the IP solution. 
	       
	       
	       One available approach is to manage the resources
     associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
     individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
     approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
     traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
     in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.

 <section title="Bidirectional traffic">
  <t> [JiK] this is managed at the management plane or controller level.
  </t>
  <t>
    Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.  Using MPLS
    definitions <xref target="RFC5654"/> there are associated bidirectional flows, and co-routed bidirectional flows.
    MPLS defines a point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP as
    consisting of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to
    B and the other from B to A, which are regarded as providing
    a single logical bidirectional transport path.  This would be
    analogous of standard IP routing, or PWs running over two reciprocal
    unidirection LSPs.  MPLS defines a point-to-point co-routed
    bidirectional LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which satisfies
    the additional constraint that its two unidirectional component
    LSPs follow the same path (in terms of both nodes
    and links) in both directions.  An important property of co-routed bidirectional LSPs
    is that their unidirectional component LSPs share fate.  In both
    types of bidirectional LSPs, resource allocations may differ in each
    direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional flows  and
    co-routed bidirectional flows can be applied to DetNet flows as well
    whether IPv6 or MPLS is used.
  </t>
  <t>
    While the IPv6 and MPLS data planes must support bidirectional DetNet flows, there
    are no special bidirectional features with respect to the data plane
    other than need for the two directions take the same paths.
    Fate sharing and associated vs co-routed bidirectional flows can be
    managed at the control level.
    Note,
    that there is no stated requirement for bidirectional DetNet flows
    to be supported using the same IPv6 Flow Labels or MPLS Labels in each direction.
    Control mechanisms will need to support such bidirectional flows for
    both IPv6 and MPLS, but such mechanisms are out of scope of this
    document.  An example control plane solution for MPLS can be found
    in <xref target="RFC7551"/>.

 <section title="Layer 2 addressing and QoS Considerations">
  <t> [JiK] combine this with the mapping section.

    <t>
        The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have
        defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref>
        that provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines packet replication and elimination
        functions that should prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.
    </t><t>
        As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
        identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
        TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the
        priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.
    </t><t>
        Although the flow identification methods described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>
        are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple identification methods, the baseline
        TSN standards assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream
        (i.e. DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that
        flow within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,

	   SB> This section should point the reader to RFC8169 (residence time
            in MPLS n/w. We need to consider if we need to introduce the same
            concept in IP.

   [Editor's note: describe a bit of issues and deployment considerations
   related to time-synchronization within DetNet. Refer to DT discussion and the
   slides that summarize different approaches and rough synchronization
   performance numbers.  Finally, scope time-synchronization solution outside
   data plane.]
  </t>


  <t>When DetNet is used, there is an underlying assumption that the
  applicaton(s) require clock synchronization such as the Precision Time Protocol
  (PTP) [IEEE1588]. The relay nodes may or may not utilize clock synchronization
  in order to provide zero congestion loss and controlled latency delivery.  In either case, there are a
  few possible approaches of
  how synchronization protocol packets are forwarded and handled by the
  network:</t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
      
    <t>
    PTP packets can be sent either as DetNet flows or as high-priority
    best effort packets.  Using DetNet for PTP packets requires careful
    consideration to prevent unwanted interactions between clock-synchronized
    network nodes and the packets that synchronize the clocks.
    </t>
    <t>PTP packets are sent as a normal DetNet flow through network nodes
    that are not time-synchronized: in this approach PTP
    traffic is forwarded as a DetNet flow, and as such it is forwarded in a
    way that allows a low delay variation. However, since intermediate nodes
    do not take part in the synchronization protocol, this approach provides
    a relatively low degree of accuracy.</t>

    <t>PTP with on-path support: in this approach PTP packets are sent as
    ordinary or as DetNet flows, and intermediate nodes take part in the protocol as
    Transparent Clocks or Boundary Clocks [IEEE1588]. The on-path PTP
    support by intermediate nodes provides a higher degree of accuracy than
    the previous approach. The actual accuracy depends on whether all
    intermediate nodes are PTP-capable, or only a subset of them.</t>
  
    <t>Time-as-a-service: in this approach accurate time is provided
    as-a-service to the DetNet source and destination, as well as the
    intermediate nodes. Since traffic between the source and destination is
    sent over a provider network, if the provider supports
    time-as-a-service, then accurate time can be provided to both the source
    and the destination of DetNet traffic. This approach can potentially
    provide the highest degree of accuracy.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>It is expected that the latter approach will be the most common one,
  as it provides the highest degree of accuracy, and creates a layer
  separation between the DetNet data and the synchronization service.</t>

  <t>It should be noted that in all four approaches it is not recommended
  to use replication and elimination for synchronization packets; the
  replication/elimination approach may in some cases reduce the
  synchronization accuracy, since the observed path delay will be
  bivalent.

           SB> I am not sure why we sould not use PREP. We should explain to the 
            reader.

		   Agree that a this can be opened a bit more in detail. The
		   issue is explained briefly in the last sentence but it

<section title="Management and control plane considerations">
  <t>
   [Editor's note: This section needs to be different for MPLS and IP solutions. Most solutions
   are technology dependant,]		 
  </t>
  <t>
    While management plane and control plane are traditionally
    considered separately, from the Data Plane perspective there is no
    practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
    information.  This document therefore does not distinguish between
    information provided by a control plane protocol, e.g., RSVP-TE <xref
    target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>, or by a network
    management mechanisms, e.g., RestConf <xref target="RFC8040"/> and
    YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/>. 
 </t>
  <t>
   [Editor's note: This section is a work in progress.
   discuss here what kind of enhancements are needed for DetNet
   and specifically for PREF and DetNet zero congest loss and latency
   control. Need to cover both traffic control (queuing) and connection
   control (control plane).]

   <t>
    The IPv6 Flow Label distribution and the label number space are out of scope of this document.
    However, it should be noted that the combination of the IPv6 source address and the IPv6 Flow
    Label is assumed to be unique within the DetNet-enabled network. Therefore, as long as each node
    is able to assign unique Flow Labels for the source address(es) it is using the DetNet-enabled
    network wide flow identification uniqueness is guaranteed.

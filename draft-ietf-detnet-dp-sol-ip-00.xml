    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can
        be found in the DetNet Architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP
        hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated
        data. No DetNet specific encapsulation is defined to support IP
        flows, rather existing IP header information is used to support
        flow identification and DetNet service delivery. General
        background on the use of IP headers, and "5-tuples", to identify
        flows and support Quality of Service (QoS) can be found in <xref
        target="RFC3670"/>.  <xref target="RFC7657"/> also provides
        useful background on the delivery differentiated services
        (DiffServ) and "6-tuple" based flow identification.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
        functions into two layers: a service layer and a transport
        layer.  The service layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The transport layer is used to
        provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
        limited reordering). As no DetNet specific headers are added to
        support IP DetNet flows, only the transport layer functions are
        supported using the IP DetNet defined by this document. Service
        protection can be provided on a per sub-net 
        basis using technologies such as MPLS <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/> and IEEE802.1 TSN.

      <section title="DetNet IP Flow Identification" anchor="sec:ipflow">
        <t>
          DetNet IP flows are identified based on IP, both IPv4 <xref
          target="RFC0791"/> and IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/>, header
          information.  6 header fields are used and this set of fields
          is commonly referred to as the IP header "6-tuple".  The 6
          fields include the IP source and destination address fields,
          the next level protocol or header field, the next level
          protocol (e.g. TCP or UDP) source and destination ports, and
          the IPv4 Type of Service or IPv6 Traffic Class field (i.e.,
          DSCP).  As part of single DetNet flow identification, any of
          the fields can be ignored (wildcarded), and bit masks, prefix
          based longest match, and ranges can also be used.
        </t>

        <t>
          DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of
          wildcards, masks, prefixes and ranges. IP tunnels may also be
          used to support flow aggregation. In these cases, it is
          expected that DetNet aware intermediate nodes will provide
          DetNet service assurance on the aggregate through resource

          Each DetNet node (edge, relay and transit) use an internal/implementation specific local-ID of the
          DetNet(-compound)-flow in order to accomplish its role during transport. Recognizing the DetNet
          flow is more relaxed for edge and relay nodes, as they are fully aware of both the DetNet service
          and transport layers. The primary DetNet role of intermediate transport nodes is limited to
          ensuring congestion protection and latency control for the above listed DetNet functions.
        </t>
        <t>
          [JiK] Flow aggregation is FFS. Might be a separate document.
          The DetNet data plane allows for the aggregation of DetNet flows, e.g., via additional tunneling, to improved scaling.  When DetNet flows are aggregated, transit nodes may have limited
          ability to provide service on per-flow DetNet identifiers. Therefore, identifying each individual
          DetNet flow on a transit node may not be achieved in some network scenarios, but DetNet service
          can still be assured in these scenarios through resource allocation and control.
        </t>

        <t>
          On each DetNet node dealing with DetNet flows, an internal local-ID is assumed to determine what
          local operation a packet goes through. Therefore, local-IDs has to be unique on each edge and
          relay nodes. Local-ID is unambiguously bound to the DetNet flow.

        <t>
          DetNet service layer introduces packet replication and elimination functionality (PREF) for use
          in DetNet edge and relay node and end system packet processing.  PREF MAY be enabled in a DetNet
          node and the required processing is only applied to packets with  a positive flow identification
          at the DetNet service layer. PREF utilizes a sequence number carried within a DetNet flow
          packets.
        </t>
        <t>
          At a DetNet node level the output of the PREF elimination function is always a single packet.
          The output of the PREF replication function at a DetNet node level is always one or more packets
          (i.e., 1:N replication). The replicated packets MUST share the same d-CW i.e., the sequence
          number is the same for each member flow of the compound flow. The location and mechanism on the
          packet processing pipeline used for replication is implementation specific.
        </t>
        <t>
          The complex part of the DetNet PREF processing is tracking the history of received packets for
          multiple DetNet member flows. These ingress DetNet member flows (to a node) MUST have the same
          local-ID if they belong to the same DetNet (compound) flow and share the same sequence number
          counter and the history information. The location of the packet elimination on the packet
          processing pipeline is implementation specific.
        </t>
        <t>
          DetNet service layer introduces also packet reordering functionality for use in DetNet edge and
          relay node and end system packet processing. The reordering functionality MAY be enabled in a
          DetNet node. The reordeing functionality relies on a presence of sequence numbers in a DetNet
          (compound) flows. The reordering processing is only applied to packets with  a positive flow
          identification at the DetNet service layer.

        This section provides informative considerations related to
        providing DetNet services via IP.

        <t>
          Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and
          terminated on end-systems.  The specific protocols used by an
          end system are specific to an application.  This
          said, DetNet's use of 6-tuple IP flow identification means
          that DetNet must be aware of not only the format of the IP
          header, but also of the next protocol carried within an IP
          packet.
        </t>


        <t>When IP end stations are DetNet aware, no application-level
        or service-level proxy functions are needed inside the DetNet domain, so end-systems peer with end-systems using the same application encapsulation format (see figure below).

          End systems need to ensure that DetNet service requirements
          are met when processing packets associated with a DetNet
          flow.  When sending packets, this generally means that packets
          appropriately shaped on transmission and received appropriate
          traffic treatment on the connected sub-network, see <xref
          target="QoS"/> and <xref target="detrouting"/> for more
          details.  When receiving packets, this generally means that
          there are appropriate local node resources, e.g., buffers, to
          receive and process a DetNet flow.

      <section title="DetNet domain specific considerations">
        <t>
          As a general rule, DetNet domains need to be able to forward
          any DetNet flow identified by the IP 6-tuple. Doing otherwise
          would limit end-system encapsulation format. From a practical
          standpoint this means that all nodes along the end-to-end path
          of a DetNet flows need to agree on what fields are used for
          flow identification, and the transport protocols (e.g.,
          TCP/UDP/IPsec) which can be used to identify 6-tuple protocol
          ports.

        <t> From connection type perspective three scenarios are distinguished:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Directly attached: end-system is directly connected to an
          edge node </t>
          <t>Indirectly attached: end-system is behind a (L2-TSN / L3-DetNet) sub-net</t>

        <t> L3 end-systems may use any of these connection types, however L2 end-systems may use only the first two (directly or indirectly attached). DetNet domain MUST allow communication between any end-systems of the same type (L2-L2, L3-L3), independent of their connection type and DetNet capability. However directly attached and indirectly attached end-systems have no knowledge about the DetNet domain and its encapsulation format at all. See the figure below for L3 end-system connection scenarios.

          <t>
            Within a DetNet domain, the DetNet enabled IP Routers
            interconnect links and sub-nets to support end-to-end
            delivery of DetNet flows.  From a DetNet architecture
            perspective, these routers are DetNet relays, as they must
            be DetNet service aware.  Such routers identify DetNet flows
            based on the IP 6-tuple, and ensure that the DetNet service
            required traffic treatment is provided both on the node and
            on any attached sub-network.
          </t>
            <t>
              This solution provides DetNet functions end to end,
              but does so on a per link and sub-network basis.
              Congestion protection and latency control and the resource allocation (queuing, policing, shaping)
              are supported using the underlying link / sub net specific mechanisms.
              However, service protections (packet replication and packet emilination functions) are not provided
              at the DetNet layer end to end.  But such service
              protection can be provided on a per underlying layer-2
              link and sub-network basis.

              Note: the DetNet Service Flow MUST be mapped to the link / sub net specific resources using an
              underlying system specific means. This implies each DetNet aware node on path MUST look into the
              transported DetNet Service Flow packet and utilize e.g., a five (or six) tuple to find out the required
              mapping within a node.  As noted earlier, the Service Protection is done within each link / sub net
              independently using the domain specific mechanisms (due the lack of a unified end to end
              sequencing information that would be available for intermediate nodes). If end to end service
              protection is desired that can be implemented, for example, by the DetNet end systems using
              Layer-4 transport protocols or application protocols. However, these are out of scope of this

          <t>
            There are network scenarios, where the DetNet domain
            contains multiple technology segments (IEEE 802.1 TSN,
            MPLS) and all those segments are under the same administrative control (see <xref
            target="fig_pref_xcrs_segments"/>). Furthermore, DetNet nodes may be interconnected via TSN
            segments.
          </t>
          <t>
            DetNet routers ensure that detnet service requirements are
            met per hop by allocating local resources, both receive and
            transmit, and by mapping the service requirements of each
            flow to appropriate sub-network mechanisms.  Such mapping is
            sub-network technology specific.  The mapping of IP DetNet
            Flows to MPLS is covered <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/>.  The mapping of IP
            DetNet Flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN is covered in <xref

          <t> An important aspect of DetNet network design is placement of DetNet functions across the
          domain. Designs based on segment-by-segment optimization can provide only suboptimal solutions. In
          order to achieve global optimum Inter-Working Functions (DN-IWF) can be placed at segment border
          nodes, which stich together DetNet flows across connected segments.    </t>

          <t> DN-RF may ensure that flow attributes are correlated across segment borders. For example,
          there are two DetNet functions which require Sequence Numbers: (1) Elimination: removes duplications
          from flows and (2) IOD: ensures in-order-delivery of packet in a flow. Stitching flows together
          and correlating attributes means for example that replication of packets can happen in one segment
          and elimination of duplicates in a different one.   </t>

            [JiK] Adapt to the simplified-IP theme

            The ultimate goal of DN-IWF is to (1) match and (2) translate segment specific flow attributes. The DN-IWF ensures that segment specific attributes comprise per domain unique attributes for the whole DetNet domain. This characteristic can ensure that DetNet functions can be based on per domain attributes and not per segment attributes.
          </t>

          <t> The two DetNet specific attributes have the following characteristics:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> Flow-ID: it is same in all packets of a flow </t>
            <t> Sequence Number: it is different packet-by-packet </t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t> For the Flow-ID the DN-IWF can implement a static mapping. The situation is more complicated for Sequence Number as it is different packet-by-packet, so it may need more sophisticated translation unless its format is exactly the same in the two technology segments. In this later case the DN-IWF can simple copy the Sequence Number field between the tunneling encapsulation of the two technology segments.
          </t>

          <t> In case of three technology segments (IP, MPLS and TSN) three DN-IWF functions can be specified. In the rest of this section the focus is on the (1) IP - MPLS network scenario. Note: the use-cases are out-of-scope for (2) TSN - IP, (3) TSN - MPLS. Note2: in current discussions the DetNet Sequence Number has an incompatible format with TSN.
          </t>

          <t> Simplest implementation of DN-IWF is provided if the flow attributes have the same format. Such a common denominator of the tunnel encapsulation format is the pseudowire encapsulation over both IP and MPLS.

          CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
          treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer
          to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
          specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
          mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
          differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
          target="RFC2474"/> and MPLS label traffic class field <xref

          point (PCP).
        </t>
        <t>
          CoS for DetNet flows carried in PWs and MPLS is provided using the
          existing MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture <xref
          target="RFC3270"/>.  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes MAY
          be used to support DetNet flows.  The Traffic Class field (formerly
          the EXP field) of an MPLS label follows the definition of <xref

          Pipe, and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and TTL processing models
          are described in <xref target="RFC3270"/> and <xref

          One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
          services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do
          not impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms
          used to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to
          requirement for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the
          resources allocated to TE LSPs via <xref target="RFC3473"/>.

          Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic treatment typically includes a
          guarantee/agreement for the service, and allocation of resources to support the service.
          Example QoS mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control, flow
          identification and isolation, and sometimes path control, traffic protection, shaping, policing
          and remarking. Example protocols that support QoS control include <xref

          target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  The existing MPLS mechanisms defined to
          support CoS <xref target="RFC3270"/> can also be used to reserve resources for specific traffic
          classes.

          In addition to explicit routes, and packet replication and elimination, DetNet provides zero

          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, there are different mechanisms that maybe used
          separately or in combination to deliver a zero congestion loss service.  These mechanisms are
          provided by the either the MPLS or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms defined
          by the underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.
        </t>
        <t>
          A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
          and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
          <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  TE LSPs can
          also support explicit routes (path pinning).  Current service
          definitions for packet TE LSPs can be found in "Specification of
          the Controlled Load Quality of Service", <xref target="RFC2211"/>,
          "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service", <xref
          target="RFC2212"/>, and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", <xref
          target="RFC6003"/>. Additional service definitions are expected in
          future documents to support the full range of DetNet services.
          In all cases, the existing label-based marking mechanisms defined
          for TE-LSPs and even E-LSPs are use to support the identification
          of flows requiring DetNet QoS.
        </t>
        <t>
          QoS for DetNet service flows carried in IP MUST be provided locally by
          the DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such
          support will leverage the underlying network layer such as
          802.1TSN.  The traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for
          IP encapsulated DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future
          document.  From an encapsulation perspective, the combination of the "6 tuple" i.e.,
          the typical 5 tuple enhanced with the DSCP code, uniquely identifies a DetNet
          service flow.
        </t>
        <t>
          Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but that have not been
          the subject of a completed reservation, can disrupt the QoS offered to properly
          reserved DetNet flows by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore,
          the network nodes of a DetNet network must:

              Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet CoS)
              packets received that are not the subject of a completed reservation.
              </t><t>
              Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for
              DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a DetNet Class of Service
              marker.

        <t>
          The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
          resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
          for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
          control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
          related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
          control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
          queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
          documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
          independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
        </t>
        <t>
          DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
          options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
          the IP solution.


          One available approach is to manage the resources
          associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
          individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
          approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
          traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
          in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.

          In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic control
          capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in the
          new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
          documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need
          to ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
          DSCP) are provided, which may include the  discarding or remarking
          mentioned in the previous sections.

    <section title="Time synchronization">
     <t>   
      While time synchronization can be important both from the perspective of
      operating the DetNet network itself and from the perspective of
      DetNet-based applications, time synchronization is outside the
      scope of this document.  This said, a DetNet node can also support
      time synchronization or distribution mechanisms.
     </t>
     <t>
      For example, <xref target="RFC8169"/> describes a method
      of recording the packet queuing time in an MPLS LSR on a packet by
      per packet basis and forwarding this information to the egress edge
      system.  This allows compensation for any variable packet queuing
      delay to be applied at the packet receiver. Other mechanisms for
      IP networks are
      defined based on IEEE Standard 1588 <xref target="IEEE1588"/>,
      such as ITU-T <xref target="G.8275.1"/> and <xref target="G.8275.2"/>.

          Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.
          While the DetNet data plane must support bidirectional DetNet flows, there
          are no special bidirectional features with respect to the data plane
          other than need for the two directions take the same
          paths. That is to say that  bidirectional DetNet flows are
          solely represented at the management and control plane levels,
          without specific support or knowledge within the DetNet data plane.
          Fate sharing and associated vs co-routed bidirectional flows can be
          managed at the control level.
          Note,
          that there is no stated requirement for bidirectional DetNet flows
          to be supported using the same 6-tuple in each direction.
          Control mechanisms will need to support such bidirectional flows
          but such mechanisms are out of scope of this
          document.  An example control plane solution for MPLS can be found
          in <xref target="RFC7551"/>.

    <section anchor="mapping-tsn" title="Mapping IP DetNet Flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN">
      <t>
        [LB] This section is TBD - it covers how IP DetNet flows operate
        over an IEEE 802.1 TSN sub-network.
        [BV to take a pass at filling in this section]
      </t>
      
        <t> [JiK] combine this with the mapping section.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have
          defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref>
          that provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
          <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines packet replication and elimination
          functions that should prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.
          </t><t>
          As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
          identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
          TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the
          priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.
          </t><t>
          Although the flow identification methods described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>
          are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple identification methods, the baseline
          TSN standards assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream
          (i.e. DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that
          flow within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
          <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> describes three methods by which a packet
          sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.
          </t><t>
          Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination MAC address
          are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further clarification of the customary
          L2/L3 transformations carried out by routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes
          may also have to move sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IPv6 encapsulations.

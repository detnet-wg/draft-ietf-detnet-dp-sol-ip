      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can
        be found in the DetNet Architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP
        hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated
        data.  No DetNet specific encapsulation is defined to support IP
        flows, rather existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to support
        flow identification and DetNet service delivery.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
        functions into two layers: a service layer and a transport
        layer.  The service layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The transport layer is used to
        provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
        limited reordering). As no DetNet specific headers are added to
        support IP DetNet flows, only the transport layer functions are
        supported using the IP DetNet defined by this document. Service
        protection can be provided on a per sub-net
        basis using technologies such as MPLS <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/> and IEEE802.1 TSN.

        This document describes how IP is used by DetNet nodes, i.e.,
        hosts and routers, to identify DetNet flows and provide a DetNet
        service. From a data plane perspective, an end-to-end IP model
        is followed.  As mentioned above, existing IP and higher layer
        protocol header information is used to support flow
        identification and DetNet service delivery.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet uses "6-tuple" based flow identification, where "6-tuple"
        refers to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol
        headers. General background on the use of IP headers, and
        "5-tuples", to identify flows and support Quality of Service
        (QoS) can be found in <xref target="RFC3670"/>.  <xref
        target="RFC7657"/> also provides useful background on the
        delivery differentiated services (DiffServ) and "6-tuple" based
        flow identification.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of
        wildcards, masks, prefixes and ranges. IP tunnels may also be
        used to support flow aggregation. In these cases, it is
        expected that DetNet aware intermediate nodes will provide
        DetNet service assurance on the aggregate through resource
        allocation and congestion control mechanisms.

        Non-DetNet and DetNet IP packets are identical on the wire. From
        data plane perspective, the only difference is that there is
        flow-associated DetNet information on each DetNet node that
        defines the flow related characteristics and required forwarding
        behavior.  As shown above, edge nodes provide a Service Proxy
        function that "associates" one or more IP flows with the
        appropriate DetNet flow-specific information and ensures that
        the receives the proper traffic treatment within the domain.

        System or DetNet Edge Node in order to produce DetNet IP flows,
        the details of such are out of scope of this document.

    <section title="DetNet IP Data Plane Considerations" anchor="dn-gen-encap-solution">
      <t>
        This section provides informative considerations related to
        providing DetNet service to flows which are identified
        based on their header information. At a high level, the
        following are provided on a per flow basis:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Congestion protection and latency control:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping) to ensure
            that the congestion-related loss and latency/jitter requirements of
            a DetNet flow are met.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Explicit routes:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Use of a specific path for a flow.  This limits
            miss-ordering and can improve delivery of deterministic latency.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Service protection:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Which in the case of this document
            translates to changing the explicit path after a failure is
            detected in order to restore delivery of the required DetNet service
            characteristics. Path changes, even in the case of failure
            recovery, can lead to the out of order delivery of data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: DetNet PREOF is not provided by the mechanisms defined in
            this document.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Load sharing:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Generally, distributing packets of the same DetNet flow over
            multiple paths is not recommended. Such load sharing,
            e.g., via ECMP or UCMP, impacts ordering and end-to-end jitter.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Troubleshooting:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, to support identification of misbehaving flows.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Recognize flow(s) for analytics:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, increase counters.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Correlate events with flows:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, unexpected loss.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>


      <section title="End-system specific considerations">
        <t>
          Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on
          end systems.  This document deals only with IP end systems.  The
          protocols used by an IP end system are specific to an application
          and end systems peer with end systems using the same application
          encapsulation format.  This said, DetNet's use of 6-tuple IP flow
          identification means that DetNet must be aware of not only the
          format of the IP header, but also of the next protocol carried
          within an IP packet.
        </t>
        <t>
          When IP end systems are DetNet aware, no application-level or
          service-level proxy functions are needed inside the DetNet domain.
          For DetNet unaware IP end systems service-level proxy functions are
          needed inside the DetNet domain.
        </t>
        <t>
          End systems need to ensure that DetNet service requirements are met
          when processing packets associated with a DetNet flow.  When
          transporting packets, this means that packets are
          appropriately shaped on transmission and received appropriate traffic
          treatment on the connected sub-network, see <xref target="QoS"/> and
          <xref target="detrouting"/> for more details.  When receiving packets,
          this means that there are appropriate local node resources,
          e.g., buffers, to receive and process a DetNet flow packets.

      <section title="DetNet domain specific considerations">
        <t>
          As a general rule, DetNet IP domains need to be able to forward any
          DetNet flow identified by the IP 6-tuple. Doing otherwise would limit
          end system encapsulation format. From a practical standpoint this
          means that all nodes along the end-to-end path of a DetNet flows need
          to agree on what fields are used for flow identification, and the
          transport protocols (e.g., TCP/UDP/IPsec) which can be used to
          identify 6-tuple protocol ports.
        </t>
        <t>
          From a connection type perspective two scenarios are identified:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              DN attached: end system is directly connected to an edge node or
              end system is behind a sub-network. (See ES1 and ES2 in figure
              below)
            </t>
            <t>
              DN integrated: end system is part of the DetNet domain. (See ES3
              in figure below)

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          L3 (IP) end systems may use any of these connection types.  DetNet
          domain MUST allow communication between any end-systems using the
          same encapsulation format, independent of their connection type and
          DetNet capability. DN attached end systems have no knowledge about
          the DetNet domain and its encapsulation format.  See <xref

          <t>
            Within a DetNet domain, the DetNet enabled IP Routers
            interconnect links and sub-networks to support end-to-end
            delivery of DetNet flows.  From a DetNet architecture
            perspective, these routers are DetNet relays, as they must
            be DetNet service aware.  Such routers identify DetNet flows
            based on the IP 6-tuple, and ensure that the DetNet service
            required traffic treatment is provided both on the node and
            on any attached sub-network.
          </t>
          <t>
            This solution provides DetNet functions end to end, but does so on
            a per link and sub-network basis.  Congestion protection and
            latency control and the resource allocation (queuing, policing,
            shaping) are supported using the underlying link / sub net
            specific mechanisms.  However, service protections (packet
            replication and packet elimination functions) are not provided at
            the DetNet layer end to end.  But such service protection can be
            provided on a per underlying L2 link and sub-network basis.

            <t>
              The DetNet Service Flow MUST be mapped to the link / sub-network
              specific resources using an underlying system specific
              means. This implies each DetNet aware node on path MUST look
              into the transported DetNet Service Flow packet and utilize
              e.g., a 5- (or 6-) tuple to find out the required mapping within
              a node.
            </t>
            <t>
              As noted earlier, the Service Protection is done within each

              mechanisms (due the lack of a unified end to end sequencing
              information that would be available for intermediate nodes).
              Therefore, service protection (if any) cannot be provided
              end-to-end, only within sub-networks. This is shown for a three
              sub-network scenario in <xref target="fig_pref_in_subnets"/>,
              where each sub-network can provide service protection between
              its borders.

            There are network scenarios, where the DetNet domain contains
            multiple technology segments (IEEE 802.1 TSN, MPLS) and all those
            segments are under the same administrative control (see <xref

            DetNet routers ensure that detnet service requirements are
            met per hop by allocating local resources, both receive and
            transmit, and by mapping the service requirements of each
            flow to appropriate sub-network mechanisms.  Such mapping is

      <section title="Class of Service">
        <t>
          Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
          often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
          CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
          treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer
          to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
          specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
          mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
          differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
          target="RFC2474"/> and MPLS label traffic class field <xref
          target="RFC5462"/>, and at Layer-2, by IEEE 802.1p priority code
          point (PCP).
        </t>
        <t>
          CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
          differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
          target="RFC2474"/> and related mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit
          congestion notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> field MAY
          also be used.
        </t>
        <t>
          One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
          services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do
          not impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms
          used to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to
          requirement for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the
          resources allocated to TE LSPs via <xref target="RFC3473"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Quality of Service" anchor="QoS">
        <t>
          Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic
          treatment typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service,
          and allocation of resources to support the service.  Example QoS
          mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control,
          flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path control, traffic
          protection, shaping, policing and remarking. Example protocols that
          support QoS control include <xref target="RFC2205">Resource
          ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)</xref> (RSVP) and RSVP-TE <xref
          target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  The existing MPLS
          mechanisms defined to support CoS <xref target="RFC3270"/> can also be
          used to reserve resources for specific traffic classes.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to explicit routes, and packet replication and
          elimination, DetNet provides zero congestion loss and bounded latency
          and jitter.  As described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, there are different
          mechanisms that maybe used separately or in combination to deliver a
          zero congestion loss service.  These mechanisms are provided by the
          either the MPLS or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms
          defined by the underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.
        </t>
        <t>
          A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
          and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
          <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  TE LSPs can
          also support explicit routes (path pinning).  Current service
          definitions for packet TE LSPs can be found in "Specification of
          the Controlled Load Quality of Service", <xref target="RFC2211"/>,
          "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service", <xref
          target="RFC2212"/>, and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", <xref
          target="RFC6003"/>. Additional service definitions are expected in
          future documents to support the full range of DetNet services.
          In all cases, the existing label-based marking mechanisms defined
          for TE-LSPs and even E-LSPs are use to support the identification
          of flows requiring DetNet QoS.
        </t>
        <t>
          QoS for DetNet service flows carried in IP MUST be provided locally by
          the DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such
          support will leverage the underlying network layer such as
          802.1TSN.  The traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for
          IP encapsulated DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future
          document.  From an encapsulation perspective, the combination of the "6 tuple" i.e.,
          the typical 5 tuple enhanced with the DSCP code, uniquely identifies a DetNet
          service flow.
        </t>
        <t>
          Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but that have not been
          the subject of a completed reservation, can disrupt the QoS offered to properly
          reserved DetNet flows by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore,
          the network nodes of a DetNet network must:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet CoS)
              packets received that are not the subject of a completed reservation.
              </t><t>
              Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for
              DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a DetNet Class of Service
              marker.

      <section title="Cross-DetNet flow resource aggregation" anchor="aggregation">
        <t>
          The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
          resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
          for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
          control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
          related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
          control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
          queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
          documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
          independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
        </t>
        <t>
          DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
          options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
          the IP solution.

          One available approach is to manage the resources
          associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
          individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
          approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
          traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
          in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.
        </t>
        <t>
          In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic control
          capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in the
          new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
          documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need
          to ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
          DSCP) are provided, which may include the  discarding or remarking
          mentioned in the previous sections.

      While time synchronization can be important both from the perspective of
      operating the DetNet network itself and from the perspective of
      DetNet-based applications, time synchronization is outside the
      scope of this document.  This said, a DetNet node can also support
      time synchronization or distribution mechanisms.
     </t>
     <t>
      For example, <xref target="RFC8169"/> describes a method
      of recording the packet queuing time in an MPLS LSR on a packet by
      per packet basis and forwarding this information to the egress edge
      system.  This allows compensation for any variable packet queuing
      delay to be applied at the packet receiver. Other mechanisms for
      IP networks are
      defined based on IEEE Standard 1588 <xref target="IEEE1588"/>,

          Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.  While the
          DetNet data plane must support bidirectional DetNet flows, there are
          no special bidirectional features with respect to the data plane
          other than need for the two directions take the same paths. That is
          to say that bidirectional DetNet flows are solely represented at the
          management and control plane levels, without specific support or
          knowledge within the DetNet data plane.  Fate sharing and associated
          vs co-routed bidirectional flows can be managed at the control
          level.  Note, that there is no stated requirement for bidirectional
          DetNet flows to be supported using the same 6-tuple in each
          direction.  Control mechanisms will need to support such
          bidirectional flows but such mechanisms are out of scope of this
          document.  An example control plane solution for MPLS can be found
          in <xref target="RFC7551"/>.

    <section anchor="ip-procs" title="DetNet IP Data Plane Procedures">
      <t>
        This section provides DetNet IP data plane procedures. These
        procedures have been divided into the following areas: flow
        identification, forwarding and traffic treatment.  Flow
        identification includes those procedures related to matching IP
        and higher layer protocol header information to DetNet flow
        (state) information and service requirements. Flow
        identification is also sometimes called Traffic classification,
        for example see <xref target="RFC5777"/>.  Forwarding includes
        those procedures related to next hop selection and
        delivery. Traffic treatment includes those procedures related to
        providing an identified flow with the required DetNet service.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet IP data plane procedures also have implications on the
        control and management of DetNet flows and these are also
        covered in this section. Specifically this section identifies a
        number of information elements that will require support via the
        management and control interfaces supported by a DetNet node.
        The specific mechanism used for such support is out of the scope
        of this document.  A summary of the management and control
        related information requirements is included.  Conformance
        language is not used in the summary as it applies to future
        mechanisms such as those that may be provided in YANG models

          As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
          identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
          TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also may need a CoS marking, such as the
          priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.

           include IP 6-tuple identification methods, the baseline TSN standards
           assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream (i.e.
           DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is
           unique to that flow within the bridged network over which it is
           carried.  Furthermore, <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>

           Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination

           clarification of the customary L2/L3 transformations carried out by
           routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes may also have to move

            packet through a specific path inside the bridged network. A
            similar interworking pair at the other end of the TSN sub-network
            would restore the packet to its original destination MAC address
            and VLAN.
          </t>
          <t>
            Placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of
            nodes. IP (DetNet) Nodes may or may not support TSN functions. For
            a given TSN Stream (i.e., DetNet flow) an IP (DetNet) node is
            treated as a Talker or a Listener inside the TSN sub-network.
          </t>

          <section title="TSN Stream ID Mapping">
            <t>
              IP DetNet Flow and TSN Stream mapping is based on the active
              Stream Identification function, that operates at the frame
              level. <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines an
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification function,
              what can replace some Ethernet header fields namely (1) the
              destination MAC-address, (2) the VLAN-ID and (3) priority
              parameters with alternate values. Replacement is provided for
              the frame passed down the stack from the upper layers or up the
              stack from the lower layers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be
              used within a Talker to set flow identity or a Listener to
              recover the original addressing information. It can be used also
              in a TSN bridge that is providing translation as a proxy service
              for an End System. As a result IP (DetNet) flows can be mapped
              to use a particular {MAC-address, VLAN} pair to match the Stream
              in the TSN sub-network.
            </t>
            <t>
              From the TSN sub-network perspective IP DetNet nodes without any
              TSN functions can be treated as TSN-unaware Talker or Listener.
              In such cases relay nodes in the TSN sub-network MUST modify the
              Ethernet encapsulation of the IP DetNet flow (e.g., MAC
              translation, VLAN-ID setting, Sequence number addition, etc.) to
              allow proper TSN specific handling of the flow inside the
              sub-network. This is illustrated in <xref
              target="fig_ip_without_tsn"/>.

              TSN Streams supporting DetNet flows may use Frame Replication
              and Elimination for Redundancy (FRER) [802.1CB] based on the
              loss service requirements of the TSN Stream, which is derived
              from the DetNet service requirements of the DetNet mapped flow.
              The specific operation of FRER is not modified by the use of
              DetNet and follows <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE
              802.1CB</xref>.

              FRER function and the provided service recovery is available
              only within the TSN sub-network (as shown in <xref

              sequence number are not valid outside the sub-network.  An IP
              (DetNet) node represents a L3 border and as such it terminates
              all related information elements encoded in the L2 frames.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can
        be found in the DetNet Architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP
        hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated
        data.  No DetNet specific encapsulation is defined to support IP
        flows, rather existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to support
        flow identification and DetNet service delivery.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
        functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
        sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to
        provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
        limited reordering). As no DetNet specific headers are added to
        support DetNet IP flows, only the forwarding sub-layer functions are
        supported using the DetNet IP defined by this document. Service
        protection can be provided on a per sub-net
        basis using technologies such as MPLS <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/> and IEEE802.1 TSN.

      <t>
        This document describes how IP is used by DetNet nodes, i.e.,
        hosts and routers, to identify DetNet flows and provide a DetNet
        service. From a data plane perspective, an end-to-end IP model
        is followed.  As mentioned above, existing IP and higher layer
        protocol header information is used to support flow
        identification and DetNet service delivery.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet uses "6-tuple" based flow identification, where "6-tuple"
        refers to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol
        headers. General background on the use of IP headers, and
        "5-tuples", to identify flows and support Quality of Service
        (QoS) can be found in <xref target="RFC3670"/>.  <xref
        target="RFC7657"/> also provides useful background on the
        delivery differentiated services (DiffServ) and "6-tuple" based
        flow identification.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of
        wildcards, masks, prefixes and ranges. IP tunnels may also be
        used to support flow aggregation. In these cases, it is
        expected that DetNet aware intermediate nodes will provide
        DetNet service assurance on the aggregate through resource
        allocation and congestion control mechanisms.

        Non-DetNet and DetNet IP packets are identical on the wire. From
        data plane perspective, the only difference is that there is
        flow-associated DetNet information on each DetNet node that
        defines the flow related characteristics and required forwarding
        behavior.  As shown above, edge nodes provide a Service Proxy
        function that "associates" one or more IP flows with the
        appropriate DetNet flow-specific information and ensures that
        the receives the proper traffic treatment within the domain.

        TSN flows could be encapsulated in IP packets by an IP End
        System or DetNet Edge Node in order to produce DetNet IP flows,
        the details of such are out of scope of this document.

    <section title="DetNet IP Data Plane Considerations" anchor="dn-gen-encap-solution">
      <t>
        This section provides informative considerations related to
        providing DetNet service to flows which are identified
        based on their header information. At a high level, the
        following are provided on a per flow basis:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Congestion protection and latency control:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping) to ensure
            that the congestion-related loss and latency/jitter requirements of
            a DetNet flow are met.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Explicit routes:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Use of a specific path for a flow.  This limits
            misordering and can improve delivery of deterministic latency.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Service protection:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Which in the case of this document
            translates to changing the explicit path after a failure is
            detected in order to restore delivery of the required DetNet service
            characteristics. Path changes, even in the case of failure
            recovery, can lead to the out of order delivery of data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: DetNet PREOF is not provided by the mechanisms defined in
            this document.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Load sharing:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Generally, distributing packets of the same DetNet flow over
            multiple paths is not recommended. Such load sharing,
            e.g., via ECMP or UCMP, impacts ordering and end-to-end jitter.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Troubleshooting:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, to support identification of misbehaving flows.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Recognize flow(s) for analytics:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, increase counters.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Correlate events with flows:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
          For example, unexpected loss.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>


      <section title="End-System Specific Considerations">
        <t>
          Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on
          end systems.  This document deals only with IP end systems.  The
          protocols used by an IP end system are specific to an application
          and end systems peer with end systems using the same application
          encapsulation format.  This said, DetNet's use of 6-tuple IP flow
          identification means that DetNet must be aware of not only the
          format of the IP header, but also of the next protocol carried
          within an IP packet.
        </t>
        <t>
          When IP end systems are DetNet aware, no application-level or
          service-level proxy functions are needed inside the DetNet domain.
          For DetNet unaware IP end systems service-level proxy functions are
          needed inside the DetNet domain.
        </t>

          End systems need to ensure that DetNet service requirements are met
          when processing packets associated with a DetNet flow.  When
          forwarding packets, this means that packets are
          appropriately shaped on transmission and received appropriate traffic
          treatment on the connected sub-network, see <xref target="QoS"/> and
          <xref target="detrouting"/> for more details.  When receiving packets,
          this means that there are appropriate local node resources,
          e.g., buffers, to receive and process a DetNet flow packets.

      <section title="DetNet Domain-Specific Considerations">
        <t>
          As a general rule, DetNet IP domains need to be able to forward any
          DetNet flow identified by the IP 6-tuple. Doing otherwise would limit
          end system encapsulation format. From a practical standpoint this
          means that all nodes along the end-to-end path of a DetNet flows need
          to agree on what fields are used for flow identification, and the
          transport protocols (e.g., TCP/UDP/IPsec) which can be used to
          identify 6-tuple protocol ports.
        </t>
        <t>
          From a connection type perspective two scenarios are identified:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              DN attached: end system is directly connected to an edge node or
              end system is behind a sub-network. (See ES1 and ES2 in figure
              below)
            </t>
            <t>
              DN integrated: end system is part of the DetNet domain. (See ES3
              in figure below)
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          L3 (IP) end systems may use any of these connection types.  DetNet
          domain allows communication between any end-systems using the
          same encapsulation format, independent of their connection type and
          DetNet capability. DN attached end systems have no knowledge about
          the DetNet domain and its encapsulation format.  See <xref

        <section title="DetNet Routers" anchor="detrouting">

          <t>
            Within a DetNet domain, the DetNet enabled IP Routers
            interconnect links and sub-networks to support end-to-end
            delivery of DetNet flows.  From a DetNet architecture
            perspective, these routers are DetNet relays, as they must
            be DetNet service aware.  Such routers identify DetNet flows
            based on the IP 6-tuple, and ensure that the DetNet service
            required traffic treatment is provided both on the node and
            on any attached sub-network.
          </t>
          <t>
            This solution provides DetNet functions end to end, but does so on
            a per link and sub-network basis.  Congestion protection and
            latency control and the resource allocation (queuing, policing,
            shaping) are supported using the underlying link / sub net
            specific mechanisms.  However, service protections (packet
            replication and packet elimination functions) are not provided at
            the DetNet layer end to end.  But such service protection can be
            provided on a per underlying L2 link and sub-network basis.

              The DetNet Service Flow is mapped to the link / sub-network
              specific resources using an underlying system specific
              means. This implies each DetNet aware node on path looks
              into the forwarded DetNet Service Flow packet and utilize
              e.g., a 5- (or 6-) tuple to find out the required mapping within
              a node.
            </t>
            <t>
              As noted earlier, the Service Protection is done within each
              link / sub-network independently using the domain specific
              mechanisms (due the lack of a unified end to end sequencing
              information that would be available for intermediate nodes).
              Therefore, service protection (if any) cannot be provided
              end-to-end, only within sub-networks. This is shown for a three
              sub-network scenario in <xref target="fig_pref_in_subnets"/>,
              where each sub-network can provide service protection between
              its borders.

            There are network scenarios, where the DetNet domain contains
            multiple technology segments (IEEE 802.1 TSN, MPLS) and all those
            segments are under the same administrative control (see <xref

            DetNet routers ensure that detnet service requirements are
            met per hop by allocating local resources, both receive and

      <section title="Class of Service">
        <t>
          Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
          often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
          CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
          treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer
          to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
          specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
          mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
          differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
          target="RFC2474"/> and MPLS label traffic class field <xref
          target="RFC5462"/>, and at Layer-2, by IEEE 802.1p priority code
          point (PCP).
        </t>
        <t>
          CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
          differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
          target="RFC2474"/> and related mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit
          congestion notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> field MAY
          also be used.
        </t>
        <t>
          One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
          services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do
          not impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms
          used to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to
          requirement for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the
          resources allocated to TE LSPs via <xref target="RFC3473"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Quality of Service" anchor="QoS">
        <t>
          Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow-specific traffic
          treatment typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service,
          and allocation of resources to support the service.  Example QoS
          mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control,
          flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path control, traffic
          protection, shaping, policing and remarking. Example protocols that
          support QoS control include <xref target="RFC2205">Resource
          ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)</xref> (RSVP) and RSVP-TE <xref
          target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  The existing MPLS
          mechanisms defined to support CoS <xref target="RFC3270"/> can also be
          used to reserve resources for specific traffic classes.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to explicit routes, and packet replication and
          elimination, DetNet provides zero congestion loss and bounded latency
          and jitter.  As described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, there are different
          mechanisms that maybe used separately or in combination to deliver a
          zero congestion loss service.  These mechanisms are provided by the
          either the MPLS or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms
          defined by the underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.
        </t>
        <t>
          A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
          and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
          <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  TE LSPs can
          also support explicit routes (path pinning).  Current service
          definitions for packet TE LSPs can be found in "Specification of
          the Controlled Load Quality of Service", <xref target="RFC2211"/>,
          "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service", <xref
          target="RFC2212"/>, and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", <xref
          target="RFC6003"/>. Additional service definitions are expected in
          future documents to support the full range of DetNet services.
          In all cases, the existing label-based marking mechanisms defined
          for TE-LSPs and even E-LSPs are use to support the identification
          of flows requiring DetNet QoS.
        </t>
        <t>
          QoS for DetNet service flows carried in IP MUST be provided locally by
          the DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such
          support will leverage the underlying network layer such as
          802.1TSN.  The traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for
          IP encapsulated DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future
          document.  From an encapsulation perspective, the combination of the "6 tuple" i.e.,
          the typical 5 tuple enhanced with the DSCP code, uniquely identifies a DetNet
          service flow.
        </t>
        <t>
          Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value,
          but that have not been the subject of a completed reservation,
          can disrupt the QoS offered to properly reserved DetNet flows
          by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.
          Therefore, the network nodes of a DetNet network must:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a

              of a completed reservation.  </t><t> Not use a DetNet
              reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for

              Class of Service marker.

      <section title="Cross-DetNet Flow Resource Aggregation" anchor="aggregation">
        <t>
          The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
          resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
          for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
          control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
          related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
          control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
          queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
          documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
          independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
        </t>
        <t>
          DetNet flows forwarded via IP have more limited aggregation
          options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
          the IP solution.

          One available approach is to manage the resources
          associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
          individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
          approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
          traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
          in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.
        </t>
        <t>
          In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic control
          capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in the
          new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
          documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need
          to ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
          DSCP) are provided, which may include the  discarding or remarking
          mentioned in the previous sections.

      While time synchronization can be important both from the perspective of

      time synchronization or distribution mechanisms.

      For example, <xref target="RFC8169"/> describes a method
      of recording the packet queuing time in an MPLS LSR on a packet by

      system.  This allows compensation for any variable packet queuing
      delay to be applied at the packet receiver. Other mechanisms for

          fields defined in <xref target="ip-flow-id"/>, using a DSCP
          identified traffic class or other field. It will be the
          responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to be able to
          properly provision the use of these aggregation
          mechanisms. These requirements are included in <xref

      <section title="Explcit Routes">
        <t>
          Explicit routes are used to ensure that packets are routed
          through the resources that have been reserved for them, and
          hence provide the DetNet application with the required
          service. A requirement for the DetNet Controller Plane will be
          the ability to assign a particular identified DetNet IP flow
          to a path through the DetNet domain that has been assigned the
          required nodal resources to provide the appropriate traffic
          treatment for the flow, and also to include particular links
          as a part of the path that are able to support the DetNet
          flow, for example by using IEEE 802.1 TSN links (as discussed
          in <xref target="mapping-tsn"/>). Further considerations and
          requirements for the DetNet Controller Plane are discussed in
          <xref target="control-management-requirements"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Whether configuring, calculating and instantiating these
          routes is a single-stage or multi-stage process, or in a
          centralized or distributed manner, is out of scope of this
          document.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are several of approaches that could be used to provide
          explicit routes and resource allocation in the DetNet
          layer. For example:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The path could be explicitly set up by a controller which
              calculates the path and explicitly configures each node
              along that path with the appropriate forwarding and
              resource allocation information.
            </t>
            <t>
              The path could be used a distributed control plane such as
              <xref target="RFC2205">RSVP</xref> or RSVP-TE <xref
              target="RFC3473"/> extended to support DetNet IP flows.
            </t>
            <t>
              The path could be implemented using IPv6-based segment
              routing when extended to support resource allocation.
            </t>
          </list>
          See <xref target="control-management-requirements"/> for
          further discussion of these alternatives. In addition, <xref

          QoS-based routing, and <xref target="RFC5575"/> discusses a

      <section title="Contention Loss and Jitter Reduction">
        <t>
          As discussed in <xref target="sec_intro"/>, this document does
          not specify the mechanisms needed to eliminate contention loss
          or reduce jitter for DetNet flows at the DetNet forwarding
          sub-layer.  The ability to manage node and link resources to
          be able to provide these functions will be a necessary part of
          the DetNet controller plane. It will also be necessary to be
          able to control the required queuing mechanisms used to
          provide these functions along a flow's path through the
          network. See <xref target="ip-svc"/> and <xref

      <section title="Bidirectional Traffic">
        <t>
          Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.
          Although this document discusses the DetNet IP data plane,
          MPLS definitions <xref target="RFC5654"/> are useful to
          illustrate terms such as associated bidirectional flows and
          co-routed bidirectional flows.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
          associated bidirectional LSP as consisting of two
          unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B and the
          other from B to A, which are regarded as providing a single
          logical bidirectional forwarding path.  This is analogous to
          standard IP routing.  MPLS defines a point-to-point co-routed
          bidirectional LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which
          satisfies the additional constraint that its two
          unidirectional component LSPs follow the same path (in terms
          of both nodes and links) in both directions.  An important
          property of co-routed bidirectional LSPs is that their
          unidirectional component LSPs share fate.  In both types of
          bidirectional LSPs, resource reservations may differ in each
          direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional flows and
          co-routed bidirectional flows can also be applied to DetNet IP
          flows.
        </t>
        <t>
          While the DetNet IP data plane must support bidirectional
          DetNet flows, there are no special bidirectional features with
          respect to the data plane other than the need for the two
          directions of a co-routed bidirectional flow to take the same
          path. That is to say that bidirectional DetNet flows are
          solely represented at the management and control plane levels,
          without specific support or knowledge within the DetNet data
          plane.  Fate sharing and associated vs. co-routed
          bidirectional flows can be managed at the control level.
        </t>
        <t>
          Control and management mechanisms will need to support
          bidirectional flows, but the specification of such mechanisms
          are out of scope of this document. An example control plane
          solution for MPLS can be found in <xref target="RFC7551"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This is further discussed in <xref
          target="control-management-requirements"/>.

               title="DetNet Controller (Control and Management) Plane Requirements">
        <t>
          While the definition of controller plane for DetNet is out of
          the scope of this document, there are particular
          considerations and requirements for such that result from the
          unique characteristics of the DetNet architecture <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> and data plane as
          defined herein.
        </t>
        <t>
          The primary requirements of the DetNet controller plane are
          that it must be able to:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Instantiate DetNet flows in a DetNet domain (which may
              include some or all of explicit path determination, link
              bandwidth reservations, restricting flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN
              links, node buffer and other resource reservations,
              specification of required queuing disciplines along the
              path, ability to manage bidirectional flows, etc.) as needed
              for a flow.
            </t>
            <t>
              The ability to support DetNet flow aggregation
            </t>
            <t>
              Advertise static and dynamic node and link resources such
              as capabilities and adjacencies to other network nodes (for
              dynamic signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for
              centralized approaches)
            </t>
            <t>
              Scale to handle the number of DetNet flows expected in a
              domain (which may require per-flow signaling or
              provisioning)
            </t>
            <t>
              Provision flow identification information at each of the
              nodes along the path, and it may differ depending on the
              location in the network and the DetNet functionality.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          These requirements, as stated earlier, could be satisfied
          using distributed control protocol signaling, centralized
          network management provisioning mechanisms, or hybrid
          combinations of the two, and could also make use of IPv6-based
          segment routing.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the abstract, the results of either distributed signaling
          or centralized provisioning are equivalent from a DetNet data
          plane perspective - flows are instantiated, explicit routes
          are determined, resources are reserved, and packets are
          forwarded through the domain using the IP data plane.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, they
          are not equivalent at all. Some approaches are more scalable
          than others in terms of signaling load on the network. Some
          can take advantage of global tracking of resources in the
          DetNet domain for better overall network resource
          optimization. Some are more resilient than others if link,
          node, or management equipment failures occur. While a detailed
          analysis of the control plane alternatives is out of the scope
          of this document, the requirements from this document can be
          used as the basis of a later analysis of the alternatives.

    <section anchor="ip-procs" title="DetNet IP Data Plane Procedures">
      <t>
        This section provides DetNet IP data plane procedures. These
        procedures have been divided into the following areas: flow
        identification, forwarding and traffic treatment.  Flow
        identification includes those procedures related to matching IP
        and higher layer protocol header information to DetNet flow
        (state) information and service requirements. Flow
        identification is also sometimes called Traffic classification,
        for example see <xref target="RFC5777"/>.  Forwarding includes
        those procedures related to next hop selection and
        delivery. Traffic treatment includes those procedures related to
        providing an identified flow with the required DetNet service.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet IP data plane procedures also have implications on the
        control and management of DetNet flows and these are also
        covered in this section. Specifically this section identifies a
        number of information elements that will require support via the
        management and control interfaces supported by a DetNet node.
        The specific mechanism used for such support is out of the scope
        of this document.  A summary of the management and control
        related information requirements is included.  Conformance
        language is not used in the summary as it applies to future
        mechanisms such as those that may be provided in YANG models

            unique Source and Destination Port field values, while
            providing a different service for all other flows with that same
            UDP Destination Port value.

          General requirements for IP nodes are defined in <xref

          target="RFC6434"/>, and are not modified by this document. The
          typical next-hop selection process is impacted by DetNet.
          Specifically, implementations of this document SHALL use
          management and control information to select the one or more
          outgoing interfaces and next hops to be used for a packet
          belonging to a DetNet flow.

        <t>
          The use of multiple paths or links, e.g., ECMP, to support a
          single DetNet flow is NOT RECOMMENDED. ECMP MAY be used for
          non-DetNet flows within a DetNet domain.
        </t>
        <t>

      <section anchor="ip-svc" title="DetNet IP Traffic Treatment Procedures">
        <t>
          Implementations if this document MUST ensure that a DetNet
          flow receives the traffic treatment that is provisioned for it
          via configuration or the controller plane, e.g., via
          [YANG-REF-TBD].  General information on DetNet service can be
          found in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model"/>.  Typical
          mechanisms used to provide different treatment to different
          flows includes the allocation of system resources (such as
          queues and buffers) and provisioning or related parameters
          (such as shaping, and policing). Support can also be provided
          via an underlying network technology such as MPLS <xref
          target="ip-over-mpls"/> and IEEE802.1 TSN <xref
          target="mapping-tsn"/>.  Other than in the TSN case, the
          specific mechanisms used by a DetNet node to ensure DetNet
          service delivery requirements are met for supported DetNet
          flows is outside the scope of this document.

      <section anchor="ip-agg" title="Aggregation Considerations">
        <t>
          The use of prefixes, wildcards, bitmasks, and port ranges
          allows a DetNet node to aggregate DetNet flows.  This
          aggregation can take place within a single node, when that
          node maintains state about both the aggregated and component
          flows.  It can also take place between nodes, where one node
          maintains state about only flow aggregates while the other
          node maintains state on all or a portion of the component
          flows.  In either case, the management or control function that
          provisions the aggregate flows must ensure that adequate
          resources are allocated and configured to provide combined
          service requirements of the component flows.  As DetNet is
          concerned about latency and jitter, more than just bandwidth
          needs to be considered.

          enabled End Systems (hosts), connected to DetNet (DN) enabled
          IP networks, operating over a DetNet aware MPLS network. In
          this figure, Relay nodes sit at the boundary of the MPLS
          domain since the non-MPLS domain is DetNet aware.  This figure
          is very similar to the DetNet MPLS Network figure in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/>.  The primary
          difference is that the Relay nodes are at the edges of the
          MPLS domain and therefore function as T-PEs, and that service
          sub-layer functions are not provided over the DetNet IP
          network.  The transit node functions show above are identical

          sit at the edges of an MPLS domain and therefore are similar
          to T-PEs, while R2 sits in the middle of the domain and is
          therefore similar to an S-PE.

        In the figure, "IP App-Flow" indicates the payload carried by
        the DetNet IP data plane.  "IP" and "NProto" indicate the fields
        described in <xref target="ip-hdr"/> and <xref
        target="nxt-proto"/>, respectively.  "MPLS App-Flow" indicates
        that an individual DetNet IP flow is the payload from the
        perspective of the DetNet MPLS data plane defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Per <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls"/>, the DetNet
        MPLS data plane uses a single S-Label to support a single app
        flow. <xref target="ip-flow-id"/> states that a single DetNet
        flow is identified based on IP, and next level protocol, header
        information.  It also defines that aggregation is supported
        (<xref target="ip-agg"/>) through the use of prefixes,
        wildcards, bimasks, and port ranges.  Collectively, this results
        in the fairly straight forward procedures defined in this

      </t>
      <t>
        As shown in <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/>, DetNet relay nodes
        are responsible for the mapping of a DetNet flow, at the service
        sub-layer, from the IP to MPLS DetNet data planes and back
        again. Their related DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS data plane
        operation is comprised of two sets of procedures: the mapping of
        flow identifiers; and ensuring proper traffic treatment.

          A relay node that sends a DetNet IP flows over a DetNet MPLS
          network MUST map a single DetNet IP flow into a single
          app-flow and MUST process that app-flow in accordance to the
          procedures defined in <xref

          network.  Aggregation as defined in <xref target="ip-agg"/>
          MAY be used to identify an individual DetNet IP flow. The
          provisioning of the mapping of DetNet IP flows to DetNet MPLS
          app-flow information MUST be supported via configuration,

          A relay node MAY be provisioned to handle packets received via

          flow, without examination of IP headers. Alternatively,
          packets received via the DetNet MPLS data plane MAY follow the
          normal DetNet IP flow identification procedures defined in

        The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1
        Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of
        amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref> that
        provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged
        networks. Furthermore <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE
        802.1CB</xref> defines frame replication and elimination
        functions for reliability that should prove both compatible with
        and useful to, DetNet networks.  All these functions have to
        identify flows those require TSN treatment.  </t><t> As is the
        case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may
        need to identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet
        belongs in order to provide the TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.
        It also may need additional marking, such as the priority field
        of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper
        service.
      </t>
          <t>
            TSN capabilities of the TSN sub-network are made available for IP
            (DetNet) flows via the protocol interworking function defined in
            <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>. For example,
            applied on the TSN edge port connected to the IP (DetNet) node it
            can convert an ingress unicast IP (DetNet) flow to use a specific
            multicast destination MAC address and VLAN, in order to direct the
            packet through a specific path inside the bridged network. A
            similar interworking pair at the other end of the TSN sub-network
            would restore the packet to its original destination MAC address
            and VLAN.
          </t>
          <t>
            Placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of
            nodes. IP (DetNet) Nodes may or may not support TSN functions. For
            a given TSN Stream (i.e., DetNet flow) an IP (DetNet) node is
            treated as a Talker or a Listener inside the TSN sub-network.
          </t>

          <section title="TSN Stream ID Mapping">
            <t>
              DetNet IP Flow and TSN Stream mapping is based on the active
              Stream Identification function, that operates at the frame
              level. <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines an
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification function,
              what can replace some Ethernet header fields namely (1) the
              destination MAC-address, (2) the VLAN-ID and (3) priority
              parameters with alternate values. Replacement is provided for
              the frame passed down the stack from the upper layers or up the
              stack from the lower layers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be
              used within a Talker to set flow identity or a Listener to
              recover the original addressing information. It can be used also
              in a TSN bridge that is providing translation as a proxy service
              for an End System. As a result IP (DetNet) flows can be mapped
              to use a particular {MAC-address, VLAN} pair to match the Stream
              in the TSN sub-network.
            </t>
            <t>
              From the TSN sub-network perspective DetNet IP nodes without any
              TSN functions can be treated as TSN-unaware Talker or Listener.
              In such cases relay nodes in the TSN sub-network MUST modify the
              Ethernet encapsulation of the DetNet IP flow (e.g., MAC
              translation, VLAN-ID setting, Sequence number addition, etc.) to
              allow proper TSN specific handling of the flow inside the
              sub-network. This is illustrated in <xref
              target="fig_ip_without_tsn"/>.

            <t>
	      DetNet flow and TSN Stream mapping related information are
	      required only for TSN-aware IP (DetNet) nodes. From the
	      Data Plane perspective there is no practical difference
	      based on the origin of flow mapping related information
	      (management plane or control plane).
            </t>
            <t>
	      TSN-aware DetNet IP nodes are member of both the DetNet
	      domain and the TSN sub-network.  Within the TSN
	      sub-network the TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node has a TSM-aware
	      Talker/Listener role, so TSN specific management and
	      control plane functionalities must be implemented.  There
	      are many similarities in the management plane techniques
	      used in DetNet and TSN, but that is not the case for the
	      control plane protocols. For example, RSVP-TE and MSRP
	      behaves differently. Therefore management and control
	      plane design is an important aspect of scenarios, where
	      mapping between DetNet and TSN is required.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In order to use a TSN sub-network between DetNet nodes,
	      DetNet specific information must be converted to TSN
	      sub-network specific ones. DetNet flow ID and flow related
	      parameters/requirements must be converted to a TSN Stream
	      ID and stream related parameters/requirements. Note that,
	      as the TSN sub-network is just a portion of the end2end
	      DetNet path (i.e., single hop from IP perspective), some
	      parameters (e.g., delay) may differ significantly. Other
	      parameters (like bandwidth) also may have to be tuned due
	      to the L2 encapsulation used in the TSN sub-network.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In some case it may be challenging to determine some TSN
	      Stream related information. For example on a TSN-aware IP
	      (DetNet) node that acts as a Talker, it is quite obvious
	      which DetNet node is the Listener of the mapped TSN stream
	      (i.e., the IP Next-Hop). However it may be not trivial to
	      locate the point/interface where that Listener is
	      connected to the TSN sub-network. Such attributes may
	      require interaction between control and management plane
	      functions and between DetNet and TSN domains.
	    </t>
            <t>
	      Mapping between DetNet flow identifiers and TSN Stream
	      identifiers, if not provided explicitly, can be done by a
	      TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node locally based on information
	      provided for configuration of the TSN Stream
	      identification functions (IP Stream identification and
	      active Stream identification function).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Triggering the setup/modification of a TSN Stream in the
	      TSN sub-network is an example where management and/or
	      control plane interactions are required between the DetNet
	      and TSN sub-network. TSN-unaware IP (DetNet) nodes make
	      such a triggering even more complicated as they are fully
	      unaware of the sub-network and run independently.
